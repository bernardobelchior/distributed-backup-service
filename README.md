## Running
Our program uses a system called JSSE in order to ensure encrypted connections.
As such, the following arguments must be given to the Java Virtual Machine
```
java -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<filename1> -Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<password1> -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<filename2> - Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<password2> <name-of-the-program> ... 
```

There are two keystores and a truststore provided in the repository for testing.
Their passwords are "123456", without quotes.

## Purpose of the Application 
Improve the Distributed Backup Service made in the first assignment, making it more robust and fault-tolerant, while allowing it to be used throughout the internet.
